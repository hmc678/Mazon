# Mazon Hebrew

Mazon Hebrew aims to be a light, open, low-contrast typeface, suitable for setting (extended) text, especially near Latin characters.  It was originally conceived of as a companion face to [ITC Mendoza Roman Std](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_std_book).

It is released under the SIL Open Font License v1.1, which can be found in the file `LICENSE` or at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL.  Detailed information about this font can be found in the file `FONTLOG`.

## Installation

To install these fonts, follow the following instructions:

- On Windows:
    - Right click the file `MazonHebrew-Regular.otf` and select
      install.  You may need administrator's rights for this.
    - If install is not a context menu (right click) option for you, you
      may install through the instructions found [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/install-or-uninstall-fonts).
- On Linux:
    - Check instructions for your individual distribution, but on many
      modern distros, it is as simple as copying the file
      `MazonHebrew-Regular.otf` to `~/.fonts`, which you can create if it
      does not already exist.
    - This, of course, only installs the fonts for the current user (you).
      If you want the font to be available for all users, there is at least
      one standard place for you to put it.  Search your root directory tree
      for a file called `fonts.conf` (mine is in `/etc/fonts/`).  The
      locations will be listed there.  Copy the font to one of them.
    - You may need to run `fc-cache` from the command line.  You can run it
      with the flags `-fv` to see what it is doing and ensure it is extra
      careful about getting every new font.
- On Mac (OSX):
    - Double click the file and a preview of the font will open up.  There
      should be a button to `Install Font`.  Click it.
