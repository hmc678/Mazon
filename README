## Notes

The directory `Draft Material` contains the raw `.svg` files that make up the font.  These are [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org)-flavored `.svg`s and may not work with other vector graphic editors.  These files are imported into [FontForge](http://fontforge.org) (saved as `.sfd` files) which is used to create the final font files.
