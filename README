# Mazon Hebrew

Mazon Hebrew is a low-contrast Hebrew font intended to be a companion to [ITC Mendoza Roman Std](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_std_book/).  It is released under the SIL Open Font License v1.1, which can be found in the file `LICENSE` or at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL.

## Files

In the root directory, you will find `specimen.pdf` a type specimen for Mazon Hebrew (as well as `specimen.sla`, a [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net) file).  In addition, you can find the text of the SIL Open Font License, this `README`, and `MazonHebrew-Regular.sfd`, a [FontForge](http://fontforge.org) file for generating the final product: `MazonHebrew-Regular.otf`.

The directory `Draft Material` contains two directories, `Letterforms` and `Punctuation`.  They contain the raw `.svg` files, one per glyph, which are imported into Fontforge to generate the font.  These are [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org)-flavored `.svg`s and may not work with other vector graphic editors.
