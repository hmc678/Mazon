# Detailed Information

## Design goals

Hebrew typefaces have a long and somewhat antagonistic relationship with Latin typefaces.  The two do not share a very common lineage in the same way that, perhaps, Cyrillic and Latin do, and thus have rather different "characters", if you will pardon the pun.  The two faces read in opposite directions.  And in particular, while Latin glyphs tend to emphasize their vertical strokes (which can be seen to a grotesque degree in the Romantic typefaces of Bodoni and Didot), Hebrew glyphs tend to emphasize their horizontal strokes (frequently to a similar degree of contrast as Romantic Latin typefaces).

The design goals of contemporary Hebrew font designers seem, to me (Ryan Dorsey), frequently orthogonal to, if not conflicting with, the goal of mixing well with Latin characters.  Many designs (found, e.g., in the Masterfont catalog) tend to have a rich rotundity that somehow doesn't match even the bowls of most romans, or a thickness that seems to be more aligned with other Afro-Semitic designs, rather than their northern cousin(s).  Also, the glyphs tend toward square (again, with emphasis on the horizontal motion) shapes, rather than the columnar rectangles of the roman.  Sans-serif fonts seem to escape these criticisms more frequently, but that leaves much to be desired when searching for a suitable type family for setting extended text alongside a roman typeface.

With that in mind, Mazon aims to be a light, open, low-contrast typeface, suitable for setting (extended) text, especially near Latin characters.  It was originally conceived of as a companion face to [ITC Mendoza Roman Std](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_std_book).  To achieve these goals, Mazon features:

- Latinate, yet unobtrusive, serifs on many letters.
- Low contrast between horizontal and vertical strokes, with the horizontal ones
  being some 170% the thickness of the vertical ones.  cf. a classic Vilna-style
  face, such as [Ezra SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/EzraSIL_Home) with a 425%
  difference and Mendoza Roman, whose book weight sports a contrast of 120% -
  150% depending on the letter.
- A narrower design.  Even letters which are iconically square (e.g., mem sofit)
  are shy of the 1:1 ratio, about 90% as wide as they are tall,
  in order to emphasize the relationship with the Latin characters' vertical
  motion.
- A "two-thirds" height.  The height of the Hebrew characters lies between the
  x-height and the ascender/capital height of the roman, so that it is easily
  miscible inline with roman characters, without disturbing the vertical
  rhythm of the line too much.

# Development

## Software

Several pieces of software have been used to help develop Mazon.  These may be of interest to persons attempting to manipulate the Font Software.  They also deserve mention not only for their contribution to Mazon's creation, but as valuable members of the FLOSS world, without which the development of Mazon would have been, at best, much more expensive, and at worst, impossible.

- [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) is used to draw the individual glyphs of
  the font, and saves them as individual vector graphics (`.svg`s).
- [FontForge](http://fontforge.org) collects the glyphs of the font, allows
  the user to edit various metrics about the font, and generates the final,
  usable font files.
- [Python](http://www.python.org) is a scripting language used by Fontforge.
  It is used to generate a "rough draft" font, which can then be tuned further
  by hand in Fontforge.
- [git](http://git-scm.com) is used to manage the source files and maintain a
  history of revisions to the Mazon Hebrew source files.
- [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) hosts the git repository for Mazon Hebrew.

## makefont.py

After editing the glyphs of the font (i.e., the material under the directories in `Draft Material`), you can regenerate the fonts by running `makefont.py` at the command line, provided Fontforge is installed on the computer.  The script will output two files into the root directory: `MazonHebrew-Regular.gen.sfd` and `MazonHebrew-Regular.gen.otf`.

Please note that the font produced by `makefont.py` is a relatively refined font.  All the niqqudot should be placed properly out-of-the-box and reasonable defaults for letterspacing are applied.  But,

- No attempt has yet been made to optically align the bearings of the font on
  a per glyph basis, create kerning tables, substitutions, etc.
- Additionally, the script will print out the string `"Failed to parse color"`
  about half a dozen times per glyph, so if you are concerned about clobbering
  your terminal with text, consider running the script with `2> /dev/null`
  (\*nix systems) or `2> nul` (Windows).

Hopefully, in the future, `makefont.py` will continue to improve, and these issues will be no longer.

## config.toml

All of the configurable data for Mazon can be found in `config.toml`.  Notably, there are data there for the manipulating the positioning of niqqudot and the
width of the various spaces.

## Source files

### Layout

The following tree represents the layout of the Mazon Font Software source tree.

    .
    |-- Draft Material
    |   |-- basis.svg               // an empty, measured grid for new glyphs.
    |   |-- Letterforms
    |   |   `-- [...]               // individual glyphs, in .svg format.
    |   |-- Niqqudot
    |   |   `-- [...]               // individual glyphs, in .svg format.
    |   `-- Punctuation
    |       `-- [...]               // individual glyphs, in .svg format.
    |-- config.toml
    |-- FONTLOG                     // detailed information about the font.
    |-- LICENSE                     // the SIL Open Font License v1.1.
    |-- makefont.py                 // a python script for generating the fonts.
    |-- MazonHebrew-Regular.otf     // a useable OpenType font.
    |-- MazonHebrew-Regular.sfd     // the Fontforge save file.
    `-- README                      // a brief introduction to the font.

The glyphs under the directories in `Draft Material` are named after their Unicode character names minus the code point, e.g., the file `full stop.svg` contains an illustration of the character `U+002E FULL STOP`, whereas `hebrew letter alef.svg` contains the same for `U+05D0 HEBREW LETTER ALEF`.  If you create additional glyphs, be sure to name them after their Unicode names.  This is both so others know what the glyph is supposed to represent and so that `makefont.py` can place the glyph appropriately in the font.

### Revision Control

The source files to Mazon are kept in a git repository, which can be found at http://bitbucket.org/hmc678/mazon-hebrew.

# Change Log

The following log lists changes from release to release.  Full history of the font and its files is available through `git log` and its variations.

* 2 November 2014 - v0.3
    - Added all of Hebrew's diacritical vowels (niqqudot).
    - Configuration data is now available for easier consumption in the
      file `config.toml`.
    - Many improvements to `makefont.py`, which now can create lookup tables,
      add anchors, and adjust glyph metrics according to its configuration
      data.
* 25 October 2014 - v0.2
    - Initial public release.
    - Most typographic punctuation are now available.  The remaining marks,
      to implement, or at least those which seem rather important to me, are:
        - `U+0023 NUMBER SIGN`
        - `U+0026 AMPERSAND`
        - `U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT`
        - `U+007E TILDE`
        - `U+00A7 SECTION SIGN`
        - `U+00AB LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK`
        - `U+00B6 PILCROW SIGN`
        - `U+00BB RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK`
        - `U+00D7 MULTIPLICATION SIGN`
        - `U+2007 FIGURE SPACE`
        - `U+2008 PUNCTUATION SPACE`
        - `U+2020 DAGGER`
        - `U+2021 DOUBLE DAGGER`
    - Note that, for the sake of this release, "punctuation marks" does not
      include niqqud, Hebrew's system of diacritical vowels.  Nor does it
      include ta'amei miqra, the cantillation marks found in Biblical texts.
      Numerical figures are also missing.
    - A build script, `makefont.py`, is also now available.
    - The quf now has a more rounded right arm.
    - Ayin is more balanced.
    - The ascender of lamed is reshaped ("more square")
    - The alternate (niqqud) ayin and an alef-lamed ligature are added.
* 16 October 2014 - v0.1
    - Initial (private) release.
    - Contains letterforms, but no punctuation.
