# Detailed Information

## Design goals

Hebrew typefaces have a long and somewhat antagonistic relationship with Latin typefaces.  The two do not share a very common lineage in the same way that, perhaps, Cyrillic and Latin do, and thus have rather different "characters", if you will pardon the pun.  The two faces read in opposite directions.  And in particular, while Latin glyphs tend to emphasize their vertical strokes (which can be seen to a grotesque degree in the Romantic typefaces of Bodoni and Didot), Hebrew glyphs tend to emphasize their horizontal strokes (frequently to a similar degree of contrast as Romantic Latin typefaces).

The design goals of contemporary Hebrew font designers seem, to me (Ryan Dorsey), frequently orthogonal to, if not conflicting with, the goal of mixing well with Latin characters.  Many designs (found, e.g., in the Masterfont catalog) tend to have a rich rotundity that somehow doesn't match even the bowls of most romans, or a thickness that seems to be more aligned with other Afro-Semitic designs, rather than their northern cousin(s).  Also, the glyphs tend toward square (again, with emphasis on the horizontal motion) shapes, rather than the columnar rectangles of the roman.  Sans-serif fonts seem to escape these criticisms more frequently, but that leaves much to be desired when searching for a suitable type family for setting extended text alongside a roman typeface.

With that in mind, Mazon aims to be a light, open, low-contrast typeface, suitable for setting (extended) text, especially near Latin characters.  It was originally conceived of as a companion face to [ITC Mendoza Roman Std](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_mendoza_roman_std_book).  To achieve these goals, Mazon features:

- Latinate, yet unobtrusive, serifs on many letters.
- Low contrast between horizontal and vertical strokes, with the horizontal ones
  being some 170% the thickness of the vertical ones.  cf. a classic Vilna-style
  face, such as [Ezra SIL](http://scripts.sil.org/EzraSIL_Home) with a 425%
  difference and Mendoza Roman, whose book weight sports a contrast of 120% -
  150% depending on the letter.
- A narrower design.  Even letters which are iconically square (e.g., mem sofit)
  are shy of the 1:1 ratio, about 90% as wide as they are tall,
  in order to emphasize the relationship with the Latin characters' vertical
  motion.
- A "two-thirds" height.  The height of the Hebrew characters lies between the
  x-height and the ascender/capital height of the roman, so that it is easily
  miscible inline with roman characters, without disturbing the vertical
  rhythm of the line too much.

## Software

Several pieces of software have been used to help develop Mazon.  These may be of interest to persons attempting to manipulate the Font Software.  They also deserve mention not only for their contribution to Mazon's creation, but as valuable members of the FLOSS world, without which the development of Mazon would have been, at best, much more expensive, and at worst, impossible.

- [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) is used to draw the individual glyphs of
  the font, and saves them as individual vector graphics (`.svg`s).
- [FontForge](http://fontforge.org) collects the glyphs of the font, allows
  the user to edit various metrics about the font, and generates the final,
  usable font files.
- [Python](http://www.python.org) is a scripting language used by Fontforge.
  It is used to generate a "rough draft" font, which can then be tuned further
  by hand in Fontforge.
- [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net) is used to design and print the type
  specimen.
- [git](http://git-scm.com) is used to manage the source files and maintain a
  history of revisions to the Mazon Hebrew source files.
- [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) hosts the git repository for Mazon Hebrew.

    `-- specimen.sla                - the Scribus save for the type specimen.

### makefont.py

After editing the glyphs of the font (i.e., the material under the directories in `Draft Material`), you can regenerate the fonts by running `makefont.py` at the command line, provided Fontforge is installed on the computer.  The script will output two files into the root directory: `MazonHebrew-Regular.gen.sfd` and `MazonHebrew-Regular.gen.otf`.

Please note, however, that the font produced by `makefont.py` is currently a very "rough" font.  While technically serviceable, you may wish to further refine the metrics of the font by hand in Fontforge itself.

- No attempt has yet been made to optically align the bearings of the font,
  create kerning tables, substitutions, etc.
- Additionally, the script will print out the string `"Failed to parse color"`
  about half a dozen times per glyph, so if you are concerned about clobbering
  your terminal with text, consider running the script with `2> /dev/null`
  (*nix systems) or `2> nul` (Windows).
- `makefont.py` is not yet capable of making a suitable character for
  `U+0020 SPACE` or any other whitespace characters that may exist in the
  future.  You will need to make these yourself in Fontforge (the release
  fonts currently use a space with a width of 300, i.e., 3/10 of an em).

Hopefully, in the future, `makefont.py` will become more refined, and these issues will be no longer.

### Revision Control

The source files to Mazon are kept in a git repository, which can be found at http://bitbucket.org/hmc678/mazon-hebrew.  Currently, this repository is kept private, but a public release will occur in the near future.

# Change Log

The following log lists changes from release to release.  Full history of the font and its files is available through `git log` and its variations.

    16 October 2014 - v0.1
        - Initial (private) release.  Contains letterforms, but no punctuation.
